## HEAD TEACHER'S MESSAGE

We use a wide range of teaching methods and appropriate resources to excite, motivate and challenge our wards to succeed. Some of or excellent resources include interactive white board technology in all our classrooms, a laptop for educational research in each classroom, an outdoor area and garden, well resourced books to amuse, inspire and inform. We understand that children learn differently, so our school has made ample provision for teaching children with special educational needs particularly [Dyslexia, Autism and ADHD] using research based and tested methods that work.
You will do well to visit us to see first-hand, how exciting the learning experience can be with LITTLE DOVES SCHOOL
